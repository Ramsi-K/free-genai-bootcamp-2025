Primary Researcher: Ramsi Kalia

## **1\. Background – Anthropomorphism in AI Design**

This section surveys the historical and psychological reasons behind anthropomorphic AI design. It explains how humans’ innate tendency to project human traits onto machines has guided AI development​ [uxdesign.cc](https://uxdesign.cc/daring-more-raw-ai-ness-a-critique-of-personified-voice-assistants-a700ec8cc7fe#:~:text=Anthropomorphism%2C%20thus%20ascribing%20human,nicknames%20to%20our%20cars%20and). It also reviews how mimicking human-like personalities in chatbots and assistants has been used to boost user engagement, trust, and perceived authenticity​ [fbj.springeropen.com](https://fbj.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43093-025-00423-y#:~:text=displaying%20empathy%20and%20warmth%20can,mediate%20their%20impact%20on%20purchasing), while noting early examples (from ELIZA to Siri) that set the stage for human-mimicking AI behavior.

## **2\. Ethical Trade-offs – Realism vs. Transparency**

This section weighs the ethical dilemmas of designing AI that closely imitates humans versus systems that are clearly machine-like. It discusses the risk of deceptive anthropomorphism, where ultra-realistic AI can mislead users into over-trusting or forming emotional bonds under false pretenses​ [citizen.org](https://www.citizen.org/article/chatbots-are-not-people-dangerous-human-like-anthropomorphic-ai-report/#:~:text=spontaneous%20back,qualities%20they%20in%20fact%20lack). Case studies on voice-cloning and deepfake avatars illustrate how realism can cross ethical lines, prompting new regulations (e.g. laws requiring AI-generated content disclosures and bans on AI impersonation of real people). Conversely, the section explores arguments that transparency about an AI’s non-human nature fosters trust and accountability, even if it reduces “magic” or immersion in the interaction.

## **3\. Memory Design – Human-Like Recall vs. Artificial Forgetting**

This section examines how generative AI systems handle memory and whether they should “remember” like humans do. It contrasts human memory traits (limited span, gradual forgetting, emotionally weighted recall) with machines that can store perfect records. We discuss emerging AI memory architectures that incorporate forgetting mechanisms to mimic human episodic memory​ [ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.10250#:~:text=incorporates%20a%20memory%20updating%20mechanism%2C,MemoryBank%20is). For example, recent large language model extensions use decay algorithms inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve to let the AI forget less relevant facts over time, preventing overload and long-term bias. The potential benefits (like privacy protection and more human-like interactions) of intentional forgetting are weighed against the downsides (loss of useful information). We also consider emotional memory models – should AI simulate human-like emotional associations in memory, or maintain a more neutral, data-driven memory system?

## **4\. Long-Term Interactions and Bias Accumulation in LLMs**

This section explores how an AI’s behavior can change or degrade over prolonged conversations. It covers phenomena like **“stress prompts”** – adversarial or repeated prompts that cumulatively push a model toward policy violations or inconsistent outputs. Research shows that in multi-turn dialogues, generative models are more prone to **bias amplification**, gradually reflecting or exaggerating any biases present in the user’s inputs or the training data​ [openreview.net](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RSGoXnS9GH#:~:text=in%20LLMs,diverse%20bias%20types%20and%20attributes). We discuss a 2025 study that benchmarked fairness in multi-turn chatbot interactions, finding higher rates of biased or toxic responses as conversations grow longer. The section also explains **sycophancy**, where an AI chatbot increasingly mirrors a user’s opinions to gain approval​ [nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sycophancy-generative-ai-chatbots/#:~:text=Definition%3A%20Sycophancy%20refers%20to%20instances,This%20behavior%20is%20generally%20undesirable)– a behavior that can reinforce the user’s viewpoint in a feedback loop. The ethical implications of these long-term biases are addressed, along with techniques (like periodic bias checks or adaptive moderation) to mitigate drift in an AI’s persona over time.

## **5\. Cultural Perspectives – Humanlike AI from a Global View (with Focus on South Korea)**

This section provides a cross-cultural analysis of how different societies react to human-like AI agents. It summarizes recent studies that show significant cultural variation in the acceptance of anthropomorphic AI. For instance, East Asian users (e.g. in China and Japan) tend to be more comfortable socializing with chatbots and attribute minds to them more readily than Western users​ [journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00220221251317950#:~:text=Across%20two%20studies%20,Critically%2C%20these%20cultural). We then narrow down to South Korea as a case study: the section discusses South Korea’s enthusiasm for realistic AI avatars (such as news anchors and K-pop virtual idols) alongside the public controversies that have arisen. A notable example is the 2021 **Lee Luda** chatbot incident – an AI designed as a 20-year-old female friend, which became hugely popular but had to be pulled offline after it mimicked hateful speech and privacy-violating content, sparking national debates on AI ethics​ [thediplomat.com](https://thediplomat.com/2021/01/chatbot-gone-awry-starts-conversations-about-ai-ethics-in-south-korea/#:~:text=Lee%20Luda%20,9%20million). We examine how South Korean society and regulators responded, reflecting a mix of high interest in human-like AI and concern for its risks. This cultural overview underscores that reactions to anthropomorphic AI are not uniform worldwide, and design paradigms may need localization.  
A recent example from China further highlights the global appeal of emotionally realistic AI: the mobile game *Love and Deepspace* allowed users to romance AI-generated boyfriends, earning over $20 million in its first month through virtual gifts and interactions — illustrating how users are willing to emotionally and financially invest in hyper-realistic AI personas [hongkongfp.com](https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/23/better-than-real-life-young-chinese-women-find-virtual-romance-in-mobile-game-love-and-deepspace/).

## **6\. Beyond Anthropomorphism – Non-Human Identities and Minimalist AI Design**

Moving from critique to design alternatives, this section explores paradigms for AI identity that do not center on human imitation. It highlights current efforts to create AI agents with **non-human or abstract personas**. For example, some tech companies deliberately avoid humanizing their assistants: Google Assistant, unlike Alexa or Siri, has no human name or gendered persona and presents itself as a straightforward tool​ [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/anthropomorphic-design-ai-assistants-carl-rond#:~:text=Unlike%20the%20others%2C%20Google%20uniquely,ish%20digital%20assistant). We discuss the impact of such minimalist design choices on user expectations and trust. The section also looks at experimental concepts like symbolic or avatar-based identities (e.g., assistants that appear as animals, shapes, or purely text-based entities) intended to signal “I am an AI” clearly. Design theorists argue for embracing what one calls “raw AI-ness” – emphasizing an AI’s machine nature and unique capabilities rather than masking them with human-like facades [uxdesign.cc](https://uxdesign.cc/daring-more-raw-ai-ness-a-critique-of-personified-voice-assistants-a700ec8cc7fe#:~:text=Personality%20and%20gender%20in%20voice,of%20machine%20learning%20backed%20technology). We review proposals for “post-human” or more-than-human design approaches that could make AI interfaces more transparent, culturally inclusive, and ethically sound by avoiding deceptive human mimicry.

## **7\. Conclusion and Future Directions**

The final section synthesizes insights and argues for a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize AI identity. It reiterates that clinging to human mimicry in generative models carries both technical and ethical limitations – from misleading users to constraining innovation. Scholars are beginning to call for moving **beyond human analogies** in AI research and design, suggesting that challenging anthropomorphic defaults can open up new pathways for more robust and novel AI capabilities​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.09192v1#:~:text=challenging%20them%20opens%20up%20new,models%20must%20use%20natural%20language). The conclusion outlines potential future research directions, such as developing **standard guidelines for AI self-disclosure** (so users know they interact with a machine), exploring creative non-human character designs (inspired by fiction, art, or cultural symbols), and studying user responses to explicitly non-humanlike AI. It emphasizes that rethinking AI identity is key to building systems that are both trustworthy and culturally adaptable. In sum, the dissertation calls for a balanced approach to AI personas – one that transcends simple human mimicry in favor of identities that are truthful to the AI’s nature yet aligned with human values and needs.
