## 📍 Executive Summary

This paper explores the evolving role of turn detection in AI-powered language learning, with particular focus on ethical design, cultural adaptation, and inclusive communication modeling. While conventional platforms relied on basic speech recognition and scripted dialogue, recent advances in multimodal AI now enable real-time, adaptive turn-taking. These systems analyze audio, gaze, gestures, and prosody to anticipate learners’ communicative cues—reshaping how humans and machines interact in educational contexts.

The research critically examines how turn-taking models reflect cultural, neurodivergent, and linguistic differences, highlighting Korean language learning as a key case study. Korean conversational norms—characterized by pause-based turn transitions and hierarchical honorifics—pose challenges for AI systems trained primarily on English data. The paper presents notable work in multimodal modeling, emotion-aware adaptation, and real-time predictive architectures, showing how these innovations improve engagement, reduce cognitive friction, and support accessibility.

A significant portion also addresses governance, bias, and data privacy. As AI systems increasingly mimic human speech and behavior, they risk amplifying exclusionary norms—especially for underrepresented languages and neurodivergent speakers. This work advocates for privacy-by-design frameworks, federated learning, AI "forgetting" mechanisms, and consent-driven personalization to preserve user autonomy and guard against digital identity erosion.

By synthesizing recent technical and social research, this paper proposes new directions for turn-aware AI in education—emphasizing cultural sensitivity, ecological evaluation, and longitudinal deployment. Ultimately, it calls for a shift from imitation toward adaptation: building AI systems that recognize and respond to the full diversity of human language use.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Turn-taking isn’t a UX polish—it’s foundational to dignity, comprehension, and engagement. When AI gets it wrong, it breaks trust. This work outlines how we begin to fix it.
