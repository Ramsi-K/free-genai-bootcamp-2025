# Prompt Engineering

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective input prompts to **optimize responses** from large language models (LLMs). Well-crafted prompts improve **accuracy, relevance, and coherence** in AI-generated outputs.

## Why Prompt Engineering Matters

- Helps guide **LLM behavior** towards desired outcomes.
- Reduces **hallucinations and irrelevant responses**.
- Optimizes **costs by improving efficiency** (fewer API calls, lower token usage).
- Enhances **control over model outputs** for structured tasks.

## Types of Prompting Strategies

| **Strategy** | **Description** | **Best For** | **Example** |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Zero-Shot** | Directly asking a model to perform a task **without examples**. | Simple factual queries, general knowledge retrieval. | "Explain the concept of entropy in physics." |
| **Few-Shot** | Provides **a few examples** to guide the model’s response pattern. | Structured outputs like classification, summarization. | "Translate the following phrases into French: Hello → Bonjour, Thank you → Merci, Good night → " |
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Encourages the model to **reason step-by-step** before arriving at an answer. | Mathematical reasoning, logic-based tasks. | "If a train travels 60 miles per hour and covers 120 miles, how long does it take? Think step by step." |
| **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)** | Expands **reasoning beyond linear steps**, exploring multiple possibilities. | Complex decision-making, planning tasks. | "How would you approach planning a startup launch? Consider different strategies and evaluate them." |
| **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** | Combines reasoning with **external tool access** (e.g., APIs, databases). | Real-world problem-solving, dynamic AI agents. | AI searches the web before answering a user's query. |
| **CO-STAR** | Contextual prompting with **structured constraints** for specific tasks. | Tasks needing guided responses with structured constraints. | "Generate a 300-word essay on climate change using an introduction, three supporting points, and a conclusion." |

## Prompt Engineering Workflow

    A[Define Task] --> B[Choose Prompt Type]
    B --> C[Iterate & Optimize]
    C --> D[Test Response Quality]
    D --> E[Deploy in Application]
```

## Best Practices for Effective Prompts

- Be **specific** – Avoid vague or overly broad requests.  
- Provide **context** – Help the model understand the task scope.  
- Use **examples** – Few-shot learning improves reliability.  
- Iterate & refine – Experiment with different phrasings.  
- Avoid ambiguity – Be clear about desired output format.  

## Applications of Prompt Engineering

- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants** – Improving user interactions.
- **Text Summarization** – Extracting key insights from long documents.
- **Content Generation** – AI-powered writing tools (blog posts, emails).
- **Code Generation** – AI-assisted coding (GitHub Copilot, Codeium).
- **Education** – AI tutors guiding students through learning tasks.

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is a **critical skill** for maximizing AI model performance. By crafting structured, context-aware prompts, developers and users can **optimize LLM responses** for real-world applications.
