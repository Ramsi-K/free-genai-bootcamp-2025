# Transformer Architecture  

## **Introduction**  

The transformer architecture, introduced in the paper **"Attention Is All You Need"** (Vaswani et al., 2017), revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by replacing recurrent and convolutional layers with **self-attention mechanisms**. This breakthrough enabled models to handle **long-range dependencies** efficiently, paving the way for modern **large language models (LLMs)** like GPT, BERT, and T5.

## **Why Transformers?**  

Before transformers, NLP relied on **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**, which had:  

- **Limited parallelization** â€“ Sequences had to be processed step-by-step.  
- **Vanishing gradient issues** â€“ Long dependencies weakened gradients.  
- **Fixed-length memory** â€“ Struggled with long texts and contextual understanding.  

Transformers solve these issues with **self-attention, parallel computation, and positional encodings**.

## **High-Level Transformer Structure**  

A transformer consists of **two main components**:  

1. **Encoder** â€“ Processes input sequences to generate contextual embeddings.  
2. **Decoder** â€“ Generates output sequences, using attention mechanisms.  

``` mermaid  
graph TD;  
    A[Input Text] -->|Tokenization| B[Token Embeddings]  
    B -->|Positional Encoding| C[Encoder Layers]  
    C -->|Self-Attention & Feed Forward| D[Contextual Representations]  
    D -->|Attention on Encoder Outputs| E[Decoder Layers]  
    E -->|Final Output Tokens| F[Generated Text]  
```

## **Encoder & Decoder Structure**  

| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Key Operations** |  
|--------------|------------|--------------------|  
| **Encoder** | Processes input text | Self-attention, feed-forward networks, layer normalization |  
| **Decoder** | Generates predictions | Masked self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, softmax |

## Key Concepts in Transformers

### Self-Attention Mechanism

- Self-attention allows the model to focus on **different words in a sequence** based on their relevance to the current token.  
- This is crucial for understanding context in language modeling.  

#### Mathematical Representation

For a given input sequence, self-attention computes:  

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
$$  

Where:  

- **Q (Query):** The word we are focusing on.  
- **K (Key):** The other words in the sentence.  
- **V (Value):** The information contained in those words.  
- **d_k:** The dimensionality of the key vectors (used for scaling).  

``` mermaid
graph LR;  
    A(Input Words) --> B(Query Q);  
    A --> C(Key K);  
    A --> D(Value V);  
    B -->|Dot Product| E(Attention Scores);  
    C -->|Softmax Scaling| E;  
    E -->|Weighting Values| F(Contextual Output);    
```

### Multi-Head Attention

Instead of a single self-attention mechanism, transformers use **multiple attention heads** to capture different relationships between words.  

| **Feature** | **Single-Head Attention** | **Multi-Head Attention** |  
|------------|----------------|----------------|  
| **Context Sensitivity** | Limited to one type of relation | Captures multiple relationships |
| **Performance** | Simpler but less powerful | More computationally expensive |
| **Parallelization** | Less efficient | Fully parallelized |

``` mermaid  
graph TD;  
    A[Input] -->|Linear Transformations| B[Multiple Q, K, V Heads];  
    B -->|Self-Attention Calculation| C[Weighted Outputs];  
    C -->|Concatenation & Projection| D[Final Contextual Embedding];  
```  

---

### Positional Encoding

Transformers **do not process data sequentially**, so they need a mechanism to **encode word order**. Positional encoding adds **unique values** to embeddings based on position.  

Formula:  

$$
PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}})
$$
$$
PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}})
$$

| **Position** | **Encoding Example (Simplified)** |  
|------------|--------------------------------|  
| Word 1 | (0.0012, 0.9456, 0.2384, ...) |  
| Word 2 | (0.0024, 0.8912, 0.4821, ...) |  

``` mermaid  
graph LR;  
    A[Token Embeddings] -->|Position Encoding Added| B[Final Input Representation];  
    B -->|Passed to Transformer| C[Contextual Embeddings]  
```

## Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) in Transformers

Each transformer layer includes a **fully connected feed-forward network** applied to each token separately.  

$$
FFN(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2
$$

| **Step** | **Operation** |  
|---------|-------------|  
| **1** | Linear transformation (projection) |  
| **2** | ReLU activation |  
| **3** | Second linear transformation |

## Layer Normalization & Residual Connections

- **Residual connections** help gradient flow during backpropagation.  
- **Layer normalization** stabilizes training by normalizing activations.

``` mermaid  
graph TD;  
    A[Input] -->|Self-Attention| B;  
    B -->|Add Residual Connection| C[Summed Output];  
    C -->|Layer Norm| D[Normalized Output];  
    D -->|Feed-Forward| E[Final Layer Output];  
```

## Transformer vs. Previous Models

| **Feature** | **RNNs/LSTMs** | **Transformers** |  
|------------|-----------------|--------------|  
| **Processing** | Sequential | Parallelized |  
| **Long-Range Dependencies** | Struggles | Handles well with self-attention |  
| **Training Time** | Slow | Faster due to parallelism |  
| **Interpretability** | Hard to understand weights | Attention scores provide explainability |
