# Large Language Models (LLMs)  

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of **foundational AI model** trained on vast amounts of text data to generate, understand, and manipulate language. They are the backbone of modern **Generative AI**, powering chatbots, search engines, and AI assistants.

## What is a Foundational Model?

A **Foundational Model (FM)** is a large-scale machine learning model pre-trained on massive datasets, making it adaptable for **multiple downstream tasks**.  

* **Pre-trained on diverse datasets**  
* **Can be fine-tuned for specific applications**  
* **Used for NLP, vision, and multimodal tasks**

## What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

LLMs are specialized foundational models built **for natural language processing (NLP)**. These models rely on **transformers** to process language efficiently.  

### How LLMs Work

1. **Tokenization** – Converts text into numerical tokens.  
2. **Embeddings** – Maps words into a high-dimensional space.  
3. **Self-Attention** – Determines relationships between words.  
4. **Context Understanding** – Captures meaning through training.

    B -->|Self-Attention| C[Context Processing];  
    C -->|Generated Output| D[Final Text Prediction];  
```

## Key Components of LLMs

### Embeddings

* Converts words into numerical vectors.  
* Captures **semantic meaning** (e.g., "king" and "queen" are close in vector space).  
* Used in **search engines, chatbots, and recommender systems**.  

### Transformer Architecture

* Introduced in **"Attention Is All You Need" (2017)**.  
* Uses **multi-head attention and positional encoding**.  
* Enables **parallel processing**, unlike RNNs and LSTMs.
