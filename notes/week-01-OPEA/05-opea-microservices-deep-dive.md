## 1️⃣ Modern Domain-Driven Architecture

### 🧩 Strategic Domain Decomposition

OPEA's domain boundaries are carefully structured around business capabilities rather than technical functions:

- **🧠 Model Registry & Governance**: Version control, lineage tracking, approval workflows
- **🔢 Feature Store**: Feature computation, storage, versioning, and serving
- **⚙️ Inference Engine**: Model serving, batching, and optimized runtime environments
- **🔬 Training Orchestration**: Experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimization
- **🔄 Data Pipeline Management**: ETL, validation, transformation services
- **📡 Monitoring & Observability**: Model drift, data drift, prediction explanations

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Domain boundaries in AI systems often cross technical and business domains, requiring careful consideration of both data scientists' workflows and operational concerns.

### 🗺️ Context Maps for AI Platforms

| Bounded Context  | Upstream Contexts      | Downstream Contexts               | Shared Language                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Model Registry   | Training Orchestration | Inference Engine                  | Model versions, artifacts, metrics |
| Feature Store    | Data Pipeline          | Training Orchestration, Inference | Feature definitions, schemas       |
| Inference Engine | Model Registry         | Applications, Monitoring          | Prediction requests, batching      |

### ❌ Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Monolithic ML Pipeline**: Treating model training and inference as a single domain leads to tight coupling and deployment challenges
- **Tech-Focused Boundaries**: Organizing services by technology (e.g., "Python Services") rather than business capabilities
- **Over-stretching Domains**: Making domains too broad, reducing their focus and cohesiveness

### 🔄 Data Consistency Patterns

**Event Sourcing for Model Lineage**:

- Store all changes to model training as sequence of immutable events
- Reconstruct model state for any point in time
- Enable full reproducibility and auditing of model development

**CQRS for Training/Inference Separation**:

- Separate write operations (training) from read operations (inference)
- Optimize each path independently for performance
- Use materialized views for specialized query needs

### 📈 Real-world Success Story

A financial services AI platform moved from monolithic PostgreSQL to specialized stores:

- TimescaleDB for model performance metrics (10B+ data points)
- MongoDB for experiment tracking (flexible schema)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings (similarity search)
- **Results**: 65% lower query latency, 3x more historical metrics, simplified schema management

## 4️⃣ Event Sourcing & CQRS

### 📜 Event Sourcing for Model Lineage

Event sourcing provides a natural fit for AI pipelines where tracking provenance is critical.

**Key Event Types in AI Workflows**:

- **📊 Dataset Events**: `DatasetCreated`, `DatasetVersioned`, `FeatureAdded`
- **🏋️ Training Events**: `TrainingStarted`, `EpochCompleted`, `ModelCheckpointed`
- **🧮 Evaluation Events**: `MetricsComputed`, `ModelCompared`, `ModelPromoted`
- **🚀 Deployment Events**: `ModelDeployed`, `InferenceConfigUpdated`

**Benefits for AI Systems**:

- Complete model lineage for reproducibility
- Audit trail for regulated industries
- Ability to reconstruct training process
- Simplified debugging of model behavior

### 🔀 CQRS for Optimized Data Access

Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates training (write) and inference (read) operations:

**Command Side (Training)**:

- Focus on capturing all training events
- Optimized for write-heavy operations
- Ensure transactional consistency of training state

**Query Side (Inference)**:

- Optimized read models for inference patterns
- Denormalized views for specific use cases
- Materialized views for fast access to model artifacts

**Implementation Considerations**:

- Event consistency guarantees (eventual vs. strong)
- Replay capability for new projection types
- Snapshotting for performance optimization
- Version tracking across events

- **🧩 Low-volume, specialized**: On-demand loading with warm-up strategies

### 🏆 Case Study: Enterprise LLM Platform

An enterprise LLM platform implemented a tiered serving approach:

- Edge cache for identical requests (30% hit rate)
- Semantic cache for similar requests (additional 15% offload)
- Dynamic quantization based on request priority
- Memory sharing across small adapter models
- **Result**: 70% cost reduction while meeting SLAs

- **⏱️ Inference Timeout**: Unexpected computational complexity
- **📦 Batch Processing Errors**: Heterogeneous input handling

**Cascade Failure Scenarios**:

- Feature store unavailability affecting inference services
- Model registry overload affecting multiple dependent services
- Training pipeline failures affecting model availability

### 🛡️ Resilience Pattern Implementation

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**:

- Prevents overwhelming failing dependencies
- Tracks error rates and stops requests when thresholds exceeded
- Particularly important for model registry and feature store dependencies

**Bulkhead Pattern**:

- Isolates resources for different workload types
- Separate connection pools for critical vs. non-critical operations
- Resource quotas for different model types

**Fallback Strategies**:

- Cached responses for temporarily unavailable services
- Simpler model versions when primary models unavailable
- Progressive degradation based on available components

## 9️⃣ API Gateway Patterns

### 🚪 AI-Specific Gateway Requirements

API gateways for AI platforms have specialized requirements beyond traditional applications:

**Key Gateway Functions**:

- Model-specific rate limiting and quotas
- Request transformation between formats
- Request routing based on model version/size
- Response streaming for generative models
- Request prioritization for SLA management

**Implementation Considerations**:

- Token-based rate limiting for generative models
- GPU-aware routing decisions
- Payload size handling for large inputs/outputs
- Response streaming support (SSE, WebSockets)

### 🔄 A/B Testing and Progressive Rollout

Enterprise AI platforms require sophisticated deployment patterns to manage risk:

**Deployment Progression**:

1. **👻 Shadow Deployment**: New model processes requests but responses aren't returned
2. **🐦 Canary Testing**: Small percentage of traffic routed to new model
3. **🧪 A/B Testing**: Controlled experiment with metrics collection
4. **📈 Progressive Rollout**: Gradual traffic increase to new version

**Shadow Deployment Architecture**:

```
Client Request → Primary Model → Response to Client
      ↓
Shadow Model (Evaluation Only) → Comparison Metrics
```

### 💬 Advanced Communication Protocols

**Synchronous Communication (REST/gRPC)**:

- Real-time operations like authentication & inference
- Bidirectional streaming for progressive responses
- Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization

**Asynchronous Communication (Kafka)**:

- Non-blocking operations like training & logging
- Event-driven processing for scalability
- Stream processing for continuous data flows

---

**Shadow Deployment**:

- New model runs alongside production
- Outputs compared but not returned to users
- Zero risk to production traffic

**Canary Deployment**:

- Small percentage of real traffic sent to new model
- Gradually increased if metrics look good
- Immediate rollback if issues detected

**Blue/Green Deployment**:

- Two identical environments (Blue = current, Green = new)
- Switch traffic completely when new version validated
- Easy rollback by routing back to blue environment

### 🏭 CI/CD for ML Microservices

ML systems require specialized CI/CD pipelines that handle both code and model artifacts:

**Pipeline Components**:

- Code testing: Unit tests, integration tests
- Model validation: Performance metrics, bias testing
- Deployment automation: Blue/green, canary strategies
- Monitoring setup: Drift detection, performance tracking

**ML-Specific Pipeline Challenges**:

- Large artifact management
- Environment reproducibility
- Data dependencies
- Non-deterministic test outcomes

### ☁️ Multi-cluster Deployment Strategies

**Federation vs. Independent Clusters**:

- Federated Control Plane: Single logical control plane across clusters
- Independent Clusters: Separate control planes with synchronized configuration
- Hybrid Approach: Critical services replicated, specialized services in dedicated clusters

**Global Load Balancing Approaches**:

- DNS-Based Load Balancing: Round-robin DNS with health checks
- Global Load Balancer: Cloud provider load balancers with health/latency routing

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Practical Decision Frameworks

### 🔀 Microservice Boundary Decision Tree

When deciding whether to split or merge microservices in OPEA:

```
Is the component independently deployable?
├── YES → Does it have its own data storage needs?
│         ├── YES → Does it scale independently?
│         │         ├── YES → Create separate microservice
│         │         └── NO → Consider team boundaries and ownership
│         └── NO → Can data be accessed via API without tight coupling?
│                  ├── YES → Create separate microservice
│                  └── NO → Keep as part of existing service
└── NO → Keep as part of existing service
```

### 📊 Technology Selection Matrix

| Requirement       | Technology Options           | Decision Factors                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Vector Search  | Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector | Scale, budget, integration complexity           |
| 🔄 Message Bus    | Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS        | Volume, guaranteed delivery needs, latency      |
| 🗄️ Object Storage | S3, GCS, MinIO               | Cloud provider, data sovereignty, cost          |
| 📝 API Approach   | REST, gRPC, GraphQL          | Client needs, performance, developer experience |
| 🚦 Service Mesh   | Istio, Linkerd, None         | Scale, security needs, operational complexity   |

### 🧩 When to Use Event Sourcing vs. Traditional Storage

```
Does your use case require complete history and auditability?
├── YES → Is temporal query capability important?
│         ├── YES → Is rebuild/replay capability needed?
│         │         ├── YES → Use Event Sourcing
│         │         └── NO → Consider time-series database
│         └── NO → Consider append-only logs with snapshots
└── NO → Is complex state transition tracking important?
          ├── YES → Consider CQRS without full Event Sourcing
          └── NO → Use traditional database with audit logs
```

- [ ] Identify all external dependencies
- [ ] Design database migration strategy
- [ ] Implement service-specific monitoring
- [ ] Create automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] Develop rollback procedures
- [ ] Establish performance baselines
- [ ] Plan for traffic cutover approach

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Cost Analysis & Resource Planning

### 💰 Cost Components in OPEA Microservices

| Component        | Cost Drivers                   | Optimization Strategies               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 🖥️ Compute       | GPU usage, inference volume    | Right-sizing, autoscaling, batching   |
| 🗄️ Storage       | Model artifacts, training data | Tiered storage, lifecycle policies    |
| 🔄 Data Transfer | Inter-service communication    | Service co-location, data compression |
