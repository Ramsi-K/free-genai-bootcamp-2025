3. **Step 3: Extract Megaservices**
   - Extract related modules into megaservices
   - Migrate one domain at a time
   - Use strangler pattern for gradual migration

```python
# Example: Strangler Pattern Implementation with API Gateway
class APIGateway:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monolith_client = MonolithClient()
        self.megaservice_client = MegaserviceClient()

        # Feature flags for migration
        self.features_migrated = {
            "user_management": False,
            "model_registry": True,  # This feature has been migrated
            "data_processing": False
        }

    def route_request(self, feature, request):
        # Route to new service if feature has been migrated
        if self.features_migrated.get(feature, False):
            return self.megaservice_client.process(feature, request)
        else:
            return self.monolith_client.process(feature, request)
```

| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Overall Resource Needs**        | Generally higher (20-30%)                 | Generally lower                     |
| **Scaling Efficiency**            | Better for uneven workloads               | Better for consistent workloads     |
| **Development Environment Costs** | Higher (need to run multiple services)    | Lower (simpler local setup)         |
| **Monitoring & Observability**    | More expensive (need distributed tracing) | Less expensive (simpler monitoring) |
| **Network Costs**                 | Higher (inter-service communication)      | Lower (in-process communication)    |

### **⏱️ Operational Overhead**

```mermaid
pie title "Relative Operational Effort Distribution"
    "Service Deployment" : 25
    "Monitoring & Alerting" : 20
    "Scaling Management" : 15
    "Dependency Management" : 15
    "Incident Response" : 15
    "Security Management" : 10
```

The above distribution typically shows higher overall effort for microservices, particularly in deployment, monitoring, and dependency management.

### **💵 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Considerations**

1. **🛠️ Development Costs**

   - Microservices: Higher initial development cost, potentially lower ongoing costs
   - Megaservices: Lower initial development cost, potentially higher refactoring costs

2. **🔧 Maintenance Costs**

   - Microservices: More services to maintain, but changes are isolated
   - Megaservices: Fewer services to maintain, but changes may be more complex

3. **🏗️ Infrastructure Costs**

   - Microservices: Higher resource overhead, better scaling granularity
   - Megaservices: Lower resource overhead, less scaling flexibility

4. **👥 Human Resource Costs**
   - Microservices: Need more DevOps expertise, potentially smaller feature teams
   - Megaservices: Need less operational support, potentially more coordination

### **📊 Real-World Cost Example**

For a typical mid-sized OPEA deployment processing 1 million inferences daily:

| Cost Category    | Microservices Approach            | Megaservices Approach                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Infrastructure   | $15,000/month                     | $12,000/month                        |
| DevOps Personnel | 2 full-time                       | 1 full-time                          |
| Development Time | +20% initial development          | +15% refactoring costs               |
