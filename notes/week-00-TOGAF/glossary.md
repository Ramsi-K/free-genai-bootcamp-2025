## **Key TOGAF Terms**

### **A**

- **Architecture** – A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at component level.
- **Architecture Building Blocks (ABB)** – Reusable architecture components that provide a solution-independent perspective.
- **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** – The core method for developing an enterprise architecture within TOGAF.

### **B**

- **Baseline Architecture** – The existing system or environment before any changes are made.
- **Business Architecture** – Describes the structure and behavior of an organization's business processes, functions, and capabilities.

### **C**

- **Capability-Based Planning** – A planning approach that focuses on delivering business capabilities rather than individual IT projects.

- **Information System Architecture** – Encompasses data and application architectures.

### **M**

- **Metamodel** – A structured framework for defining enterprise architecture concepts.
- **Migration Planning** – The process of transitioning from a baseline to a target architecture.

### **O**

- **Opportunities & Solutions** – Phase in ADM where architecture solutions are identified.
