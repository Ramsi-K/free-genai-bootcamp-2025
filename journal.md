- Worked on the **High-Level Architecture** as guided in the bootcamp tutorial.
- Struggled with **Mid-Level & Low-Level Design**, currently researching best practices and structured learning resources.
- Updated the **main README** to reflect **Korean Hagwon** instead of Japanese.

## Day 7: February 4, 2025

- Spent significant time researching **TOGAF** to gain a clearer understanding of enterprise architecture.
- Attempted to read the **official TOGAF documentation**, but found it dense and difficult to navigate.
- Engaged with **enterprise architecture professionals** on Discord and Reddit to seek advice on learning strategies.
- Based on recommendations, enrolled in a **Coursera TOGAF course** (free audit option).
- Completed **Module 1** of the course and took detailed notes in **Markdown format**.

## Day 6: February 3, 2025

- Developed a detailed **business scenario** for the HagXwon AI-powered language learning platform.
- Scoped out key **functional and business requirements**, ensuring alignment with real-world hagwon industry needs.
- Researched **TOGAF and enterprise architecture** principles to understand structured methodologies for large-scale AI implementation.
- Developed a **general understanding of TOGAF ADM framework** and how it applies to AI-powered education platforms.

## Day 5: February 1, 2025
