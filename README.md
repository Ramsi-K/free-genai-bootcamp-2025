# GenAI Bootcamp 2025  

This repository documents my journey through the **GenAI Bootcamp 2025** organized by [Andrew Brown](https://www.exampro.co/). I’ll be designing and developing **AI-powered learning applications**, focusing on real-world **GenAI solutions**, model selection, prompt engineering, and cloud deployment.  

## **Bootcamp Overview**  

The **GenAI Bootcamp 2025** is designed to help participants:  

- Understand the **capabilities & limitations** of GenAI.  
- Apply GenAI to **real-world business cases** through projects.  
- Learn to **architect & deploy GenAI workloads** effectively.  

Each week, the difficulty level **increases**, requiring strong problem-solving and adaptability. Many participants may drop out, but I plan to **push through and complete all challenges**.  

## **Business Scenario**  

I've been hired as an **AI Engineer** for a **Korean Hagwon (Language Learning Center)** to:

- Expand **language learning** through AI-powered applications.
- Enhance **student engagement** between instructor-led classes.
- Leverage **AI for personalized English-Korean language practice.**

Many students struggle with real-world English fluency due to a lack of **interactive, personalized practice**. These AI-powered apps aim to **bridge that gap**.

## **Planned Learning Applications**

- **Daily Life Visual Novel Generator:** A town-based learning app where users engage in **daily routine conversations** with variation.
- **Korean Text Adventure:** A **story-driven** language learning game that **gradually introduces vocabulary and grammar**.
- **English-Korean Sentence Constructor:** Helps users **translate English sentences into Korean** through guided AI feedback.
- **Sign to Speak:** A KSL (Korean Sign Language) learning app that uses a **webcam to recognize fingerspelling**.
- **Subtitles to Vocabulary:** Extracts **new vocabulary words from movie subtitle files** for efficient learning.
- **Speech to Learn:** Provides **real-time feedback** on pronunciation and fluency in a target language.
 

## **Technical Prerequisites**

- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face, Lightning.AI, Intel Tiber Developer Cloud, CIVO  
- **Dev & Deployment**: GitHub, Gitpod, Codespaces, MongoDB, Lucid Charts, Vercel/v0  

## **Challenges & Learnings**  

This section will be **updated as I progress**, documenting:  

- Key **technical challenges** encountered.  
- **Solutions and lessons learned** along the way.  
- **Reflections on growth** throughout the bootcamp.  

## **My Approach to the Bootcamp**  

To stay on track and maximize learning, I’ll be following this mindset:  

- **Structured Learning** – Active participation in every session, Q&A, and discussions.  
- **Time Management** – Dedicated **study & coding time** each week.  
- **Collaboration** – Engaging with other participants, sharing insights.  
- **Problem-Solving First** – Debugging & troubleshooting before asking for help.  
- **Consistency Over Perfection** – **Finishing tasks** rather than waiting for the perfect solution.
