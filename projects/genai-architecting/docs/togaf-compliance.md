## TOGAF Compliance Objectives

This section ensures that each **TOGAF phase** aligns with the overall **AI project architecture** while meeting governance, compliance, and operational standards.

### **Governance & Compliance (Preliminary Phase)**

- Establishing **architecture principles** for AI governance.
- Ensuring **PIPA compliance, secure data handling, and scalable deployment**.
- ðŸ“Œ **Artifacts:** Architecture Principles Document, Governance Model

### **Risk & Compliance Tracking**

- Maintaining a **risk log** to mitigate **model bias, security vulnerabilities, and ethical concerns**.
- Documenting **compliance frameworks** relevant to AI governance.
- ðŸ“Œ **Artifacts:** Compliance Checklist, Risk Assessment Report

### **Change Management & System Evolution**

- **Tracking change requests** for AI system updates and refinements.
- Ensuring that **architecture decisions evolve with project needs**.
- ðŸ“Œ **Artifacts:** Change Request Log, Architecture Review Board Records
