# Japanese Sentence Constructor

## Difficulty: Level 100

## Business Goal
A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students in translating a target English sentence into Japanese. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer but only to offer guidance.

## Key Question
Will AI-powered assistants replace real teachers?

## Technical Uncertainty

- How well can an AI-powered assistant perform a very broad task?
- Would a broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?
- Does using an AI-powered assistant provide an effective environment for rapidly prototyping agents?
- How could we take the agent built in an AI-powered assistant and reimplement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?
- How much effort is required to rework prompt documents from one AI-powered assistant to another?
- What prompting techniques can be naturally discovered when working within the confines of an AI-powered assistant?
- Are there any unique innovations in specific AI-powered assistants that align with our business goal?
- What were we able to achieve based on our AI-powered assistant choice, hardware, or budget limitations?

## Technical Restrictions
An AI-powered assistant of the developerâ€™s choice must be used. Some examples include:

- [Meta AI](https://www.meta.ai/) (Free, cloud-based)
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) (Free but limited, Paid ~ $20/month)
- [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) (Free but limited, Paid ~ $30/month)
- [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) (Free, cloud-based)
- [Ollama + Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) (Free, local deployment)
- [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/) (Self-hosted option)
- [Leon](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon) (Open-source AI assistant)

These restrictions ensure that developers explore and leverage existing AI-powered assistants while adhering to a constrained development environment.
