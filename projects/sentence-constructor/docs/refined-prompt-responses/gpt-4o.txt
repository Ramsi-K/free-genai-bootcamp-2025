그 책을 읽어
ChatGPT said:
You're on the right track! Let's analyze your sentence step by step. 😊

📌 Review of Your Sentence:
그 책을 읽어.

✅ Object: 책을 (책 + object particle 을) – Correct!
✅ Verb: 읽어 (읽다 conjugated to casual present tense) – Correct!
❌ Subject: "그" is often used as a determiner (like "that" in English) rather than "he."

🔹 Correction Hint:

If you want to say "He reads a book," the subject "he" in Korean is more naturally expressed as 그는 (그 + topic particle 는).
Your sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds more like "That book, (someone) reads it."
Also, 읽어 is casual speech. If you want a polite form, use 읽어요.
👉 Try again using 그는 for "he" and see if you can make a polite version too! 😊

Good sentence! 😊 However, let's go back to the original sentence: "We watch a movie."

Your sentence "나는 밥을 먹어요." means "I eat rice (or a meal)."
Let's correct it to match "We watch a movie."

"영화" (movie) needs the correct object particle. Should it be "영화을" or "영화를"?
"보다" (to watch) must be conjugated into present tense. What is the correct form?
