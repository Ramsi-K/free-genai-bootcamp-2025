In Korean, you don't need the subject marker "는" after "우리" in this case. Just "우리" is sufficient.
With the verb "보다", you should conjugate it to the present tense informal form "봐" or the polite form "봐요".
The object marker "를" should be added after "영화" to indicate that it's the object being watched.

Try putting those pieces together and attempt the sentence again. You're getting close! CopyRetryR우리 영화를 봐요Edit📌 Feedback on Student Attempt:

📌 Sentence Structure:
(Subject) + (Object) + (Verb)
📌 Hints & Tips:

The subject "그녀" can be followed by the subject marker "는" or "가" depending on the context.
The object "책" should be followed by the object marker "을" to indicate that it's being read.
The verb "읽다" should be conjugated to the polite present tense form "읽어요".

Try constructing the sentence again using the provided vocabulary and considering the hints. You're on the right path! CopyRetryR그녀는 책을 마셔요Edit📌 Feedback on Student Attempt:
Good effort, but there's a mix-up with the vocabulary. Let's review:

You correctly used "그녀는" (she) as the subject with the subject marker "는".
"책을" (book) is the correct object with the object marker "을".
However, "마셔요" means "drink" (polite present tense form of 마시다), which doesn't fit the context of reading a book.

📌 Hints & Tips:

The verb you need is "읽다" (to read), not "마시다" (to drink).
Conjugate "읽다" to the polite present tense form "읽어요".

📌 Sentence Structure Reminder:
(Subject) + (Object) + (Verb)
Please try the sentence one more time, using the verb "읽다" (to read) instead of "마시다" (to drink). You're very close to getting it right! CopyRetryR그녀는 책을 읽셔요Edit📌 Feedback on Student Attempt:
You're very close! Your sentence structure and word order are correct, but there's a small mistake with the verb conjugation.

"그녀는" (she) is the correct subject with the subject marker "는".
"책을" (book) is the correct object with the object marker "을".
However, "읽셔요" is the honorific form of "읽다" (to read), which is used when talking about someone else's actions in a highly respectful manner, such as referring to a teacher, boss, or elder.

📌 Hints & Tips:

In this case, we don't need to use the honorific form because "she" is likely someone of equal or lower social status.
Instead, use the polite present tense form "읽어요".

📌 Correct Sentence:
"그녀는 책을 읽어요." (She reads a book.)
Excellent work on getting the sentence structure and vocabulary right! Just remember to use "읽어요" (polite present tense) instead of "읽셔요" (honorific form) for this context.

Remember to conjugate the verb to the past tense and use the appropriate particles. Give it a try! CopyRetryR나는 김밥을 먹었다Edit📌 Feedback on Student Attempt:
You've done a great job constructing a sentence in the past tense, but the object in your sentence doesn't match the prompt. Let's take a closer look:

"나는" (I) is the correct subject with the optional subject marker "는".
"김밥을" (gimbap) is the object with the object marker "을", but the prompt asked for "김치" (kimchi).
"먹었다" is the verb "먹다" (to eat) correctly conjugated to the past tense form.

📌 Hints & Tips:

Replace "김밥" (gimbap) with "김치" (kimchi) to match the vocabulary provided in the prompt.
Keep the object marker "을" after "김치".
The verb conjugation "먹었다" (ate) is perfect for this sentence.

📌 Sentence Structure Reminder:
(Subject) + (Object) + (Verb)
Please try the sentence again, using "김치" (kimchi) as the object. You're very close to getting it right! CopyRetryR나는 김치 먹었다Edit📌 Feedback on Student Attempt:
Great attempt! You're very close to getting the sentence correct. Let's review your progress:

"나는" (I) is the correct subject with the optional subject marker "는".
"김치" (kimchi) is the correct object, matching the vocabulary provided in the prompt.
"먹었다" is the verb "먹다" (to eat) correctly conjugated to the past tense form.

However, you're missing the object marker "를" after "김치". In Korean, the object marker is necessary to indicate that "kimchi" is the object being eaten.
📌 Correct Sentence:
"나는 김치를 먹었다" or "나는 김치를 먹었어요" (I ate kimchi)

"나는" (I) - subject with optional subject marker "는"
"김치를" (kimchi) - object with necessary object marker "를"
"먹었다" or "먹었어요" - verb "먹다" (to eat) conjugated to the past tense form, either in the informal or polite style

Excellent work on correctly using the subject, object, and conjugating the verb to the past tense. Just remember to include the object marker "를" after the object "김치".
