✅ Great job! Your sentence "나는 밥을 먹어요." is grammatically correct and polite. Here’s a breakdown of why it works:

📌 Sentence Breakdown

ChatGPT said:
You're very close! Let's refine your sentence step by step.

📌 Your Attempt:
그녀는 물 마셔 ❌ (Almost correct, but missing verb conjugation for politeness/formality)

📌 Vocabulary Table
Korean (Hangul)	Romanization	English Meaning
그녀	geunyeo	She (used in writing, less common in speech)
물	mul	Water
마시다	masida	To drink
📌 Sentence Structure
(Subject) + (Object) + (Verb)
✔ Subject: 그녀는 (She, with topic particle)
✔ Object: 물 (Water)
✔ Verb: 마시다 (To drink) → Needs correct conjugation

📌 Fixing the Verb
"마셔" (informal, casual) → OK for close friends
"마셔요" (polite) → Recommended for general use
"마십니다" (formal) → Business or official setting
✅ Corrected Sentences:
1️⃣ Casual: 그녀는 물 마셔.
2️⃣ Polite: 그녀는 물 마셔요. (Recommended)
3️⃣ Formal: 그녀는 물 마십니다.

🔹 Extra Note on "그녀"
"그녀" is mostly used in writing, not spoken Korean. In conversation, it’s more natural to say:
👉 그 사람은 물 마셔요. (That person drinks water.)
👉 걔는 물 마셔. (She drinks water - casual, for close friends)
