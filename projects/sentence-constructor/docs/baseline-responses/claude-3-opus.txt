You're very close! Just a couple of small tweaks:

You used the correct subject particle 는 after 나 to emphasize the subject. Well done!

📌 AI Feedback:
Great attempt! You've got the basic structure down. Just a couple of small adjustments:

After 물 (water), you need to add the object particle 을 to mark it as the object of the verb.
The verb 마시다 should be conjugated to the present tense informal form. Instead of 마셔, it should be 마셔요 or 마신다 depending on the politeness level.

For a polite, formal sentence, it would be:
그녀는 물을 마십니다.
For a casual, informal sentence, you could say:
그녀는 물을 마셔.
Both mean "She drinks water", just at different politeness levels.
