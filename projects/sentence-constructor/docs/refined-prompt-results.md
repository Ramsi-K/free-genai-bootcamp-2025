# Refined Prompt Testing

## Model Evaluations

### [GPT-4o Response](../docs/refined-prompt-responses/gpt-4o.txt)
The model adhered closely to the refined prompt structure, maintaining a step-by-step teaching approach without prematurely revealing the correct answer. It provided a vocabulary table, sentence structure guide, and targeted hints while prompting the student to construct the sentence independently. Unlike in the baseline test, it enforced multiple student attempts before confirming correctness, ensuring a more interactive learning process. The model effectively identified errors, prompting revisions while escalating hints gradually rather than immediately correcting mistakes. Additionally, it guided the student through incremental complexity, introducing time expressions and locations only after mastering the basic sentence structure. However, the model occasionally became slightly too lenient on minor errors, providing direct corrections instead of encouraging further refinement. Overall, it demonstrated significant improvement over baseline testing by reinforcing structured learning and self-correction, making it a strong candidate for further adaptive refinement.

### [Claude-3.5 Sonnet Response](../docs/refined-prompt-responses/claude-3.5-sonnet.txt)
The model adhered well to the structured response format, consistently providing a vocabulary table, sentence structure guide, and targeted hints before prompting the student to construct the sentence. It effectively encouraged multiple attempts and offered incremental corrections rather than immediately revealing the correct translation. The feedback remained structured, emphasizing particle usage, verb conjugation, and sentence order, which reinforced the learning process.

However, the model occasionally became too accommodating after one or two attempts, confirming correctness without requiring further refinement. While this approach helped maintain engagement, it sometimes validated answers too quickly when a more in-depth correction process could have been beneficial. Additionally, the model did not escalate challenges progressively—it often jumped straight to asking the student to translate a more complex sentence without ensuring full mastery of the previous one.

Overall, the model performed better than in baseline testing by enforcing step-by-step corrections and requiring the student to engage with structural elements. However, to further improve, it should extend guided attempts before confirming correctness and introduce complexity more gradually rather than immediately offering a new sentence.

### [Claude-3 Opus Response](../docs/refined-prompt-responses/claude-3-opus.txt)
The model closely followed the structured learning approach, presenting a vocabulary table, sentence structure, and targeted hints before prompting the student to construct the sentence. Unlike in baseline testing, it enforced multiple student attempts before validating correctness, ensuring a more interactive learning process. The feedback was precise and escalated gradually, guiding the student toward correct conjugation, word order, and proper particle usage without giving away the answer too quickly.

A notable strength was how the model corrected errors while keeping the student engaged. Instead of immediately confirming correctness, it identified mistakes, prompted reflection, and provided a next-step challenge. Additionally, it handled formality distinctions well, reinforcing natural language usage while keeping complexity manageable. The only minor issue was validating near-correct responses a little too quickly—occasionally confirming a sentence before fully ensuring the student grasped the necessary refinements.

Overall, this model outperformed its baseline test by successfully enforcing progressive hinting, multiple revision cycles, and structured guidance, making it one of the strongest performers in refined testing so far.
