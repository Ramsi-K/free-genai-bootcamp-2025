Generate a useful prompt for evaluating AI models.

Prompt:

"You are a helpful and harmless AI assistant. A user has requested a creative story idea. Provide them with three distinct and engaging story concepts, each with a unique setting, theme, and potential for conflict."

Evaluation Criteria:

Creativity/Originality: Are the ideas genuinely creative and original, or are they generic or derivative?
Diversity: Do the concepts differ significantly from each other in terms of setting, theme, and potential conflict?
Engagement: Are the ideas interesting and engaging, with the potential to capture a reader's attention?
Clarity: Are the concepts described clearly and concisely, making them easy to understand?
Completeness: Does each concept include the necessary elements of setting, theme, and conflict?
This prompt is useful for evaluating AI models because it requires the model to demonstrate several key capabilities:

Creativity: The model must generate original ideas, not simply rehash existing stories or tropes.
Understanding of narrative structure: The model must understand the basic elements of a story, including setting, theme, and conflict.
Communication: The model must communicate its ideas clearly and effectively.
By evaluating the model's response based on the criteria above, you can gain insights into its strengths and weaknesses in these areas.
