Explain the difference between formal and informal speech in Korean.

Korean has a complex system of honorifics, which are grammatical forms that express varying levels of respect and social distance. This affects verb endings, vocabulary choices, and overall sentence structure.

Formal speech (존댓말 - jondetmal) is used in situations where politeness and respect are essential. This includes:

Speaking to elders or people of higher social status.
Formal settings like workplaces, schools, or when meeting someone for the first time.
Public speaking or broadcasting.
Informal speech (반말 - banmal) is used with close friends, family members, and people of the same age or younger, especially in casual settings.

Here's a table summarizing some key differences:

Feature	Formal Speech	Informal Speech
Verb Endings	-ㅂ니다/-습니다 (-mnida/-seumnida), -아요/어요 (-ayo/-eoyo)	-아/-어 (-a/-eo), -지 (-ji)
Pronouns	저 (jeo - I), 당신 (dangsin - you)	나 (na - I), 너 (neo - you)
Sentence Ending Particles	-요 (-yo)	없음 (eopseo - none)
Vocabulary	More Sino-Korean words, formal vocabulary	More native Korean words, casual vocabulary

For example, "thank you" can be expressed as:

Formal: 감사합니다 (gamsahamnida)
Informal: 고마워 (gomawo)
Using the wrong speech level can be considered rude or awkward, so it's important to be mindful of the context and your relationship with the listener.
