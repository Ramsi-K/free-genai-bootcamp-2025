Explain the difference between formal and informal speech in Korean.

In Korean, there are several levels of formality and politeness in speech, which are determined by the relationship between the speaker and the listener, as well as the social context. Here are the main differences between formal and informal speech in Korean:
Formal Speech (* , jondaen-mal):**
Used when speaking to someone who is older, in a position of authority, or of higher social status.
Polite and respectful language is used, with verb endings and vocabulary that convey deference.
Commonly used in formal situations, such as business meetings, official events, and when speaking to strangers.
Informal Speech (* , haengbok-mal):**
Used with friends, family members, and people of similar age or social status.
More casual and familiar language is used, with verb endings and vocabulary that are more relaxed.
Commonly used in everyday conversations, social gatherings, and with people you have a close relationship with.
Some key differences between formal and informal speech in Korean include:
Verb endings: Formal speech uses verb endings such as *** (-da), *** (-nida), and *** (-supnida), while informal speech uses *** (-da), *** (-ya), and *** (-eo).
Vocabulary: Formal speech uses more polite and formal vocabulary, such as *** (, sajangnim, "manager") instead of *** (, ajussi, "mister").
Honorifics: Formal speech uses honorifics, such as *** (, -si-), to show respect and deference.
Here's an example of the same sentence in both formal and informal speech:
Formal: *** ?** (Ji-neun achim-e geukkamgwi-reul bwat-seubnida?) - "Did you see the raven this morning?"
Informal: *** ?** (Neoneun achim-e geukkamgwi-reul bwat-eo?) - "Did you see the raven this morning?"
In summary, formal speech in Korean is used to show respect and deference, while informal speech is used with people you have a close relationship with or in casual situations.
