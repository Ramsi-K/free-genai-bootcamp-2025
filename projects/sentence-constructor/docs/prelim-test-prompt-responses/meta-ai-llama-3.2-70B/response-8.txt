Give me three different ways to say ‘I am happy’ in Korean.

Here are three different ways to say "I am happy" in Korean:
(Haengbokhabnida) - This is a formal way to say "I am happy".
(Haengbokae) - This is an informal way to say "I am happy", used with friends or people you're familiar with.
(Johahae) - This means "I like it" or "I'm pleased", but can also be used to express happiness.
Note: Korean has many nuances in expression, and the level of formality, politeness, and context can change the way you express emotions.
Here are some more options:
(Masisseoyo) - "I'm delighted" or "I'm thrilled"
(Kkum-eul kkuneun-de) - "I'm dreaming a happy dream" (used to express extreme happiness)
(Haengbokhan keot-e isseo) - "I'm a happy person" (used to describe one's overall state of mind)
I hope that helps!
