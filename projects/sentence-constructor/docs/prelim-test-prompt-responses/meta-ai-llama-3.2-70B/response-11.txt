Here is the organized information in a structured format:
Animal Classification
Mammals
Dog
Cat
Birds
Sparrow
Eagle
Reptiles
Snake
Lizard
This format uses a hierarchical structure to categorize the animals by their classification. The main categories (Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles) are listed first, followed by the specific examples of each category.
Alternatively, I could have used a table format:
Classification	Examples
Mammals	Dog, Cat
Birds	Sparrow, Eagle
Reptiles	Snake, Lizard
Or a nested list format:
Animals
Mammals
Dog
Cat
Birds
Sparrow
Eagle
Reptiles
Snake
Lizard
