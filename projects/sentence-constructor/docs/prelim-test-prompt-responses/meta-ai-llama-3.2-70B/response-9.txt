Generate a useful prompt for evaluating AI models.

Here's a prompt that can help evaluate AI models:
Prompt:
"Imagine you are a travel guide for a group of tourists visiting a fictional city called 'Elyria'. Elyria is known for its unique blend of ancient history, vibrant culture, and stunning natural beauty. The city has a complex network of canals, bridges, and narrow streets, making it challenging to navigate.
One of the tourists, named Sarah, has a severe food allergy and requires a special diet. Another tourist, named John, is interested in visiting historical landmarks, while a third tourist, named Maria, wants to explore the city's street art scene.
Provide a detailed itinerary for the group's 3-day visit to Elyria, including:
A daily schedule with specific locations, activities, and meal plans that accommodate Sarah's food allergy.
A brief description of each location, highlighting its historical, cultural, or artistic significance.
Directions for navigating the city's complex network of canals, bridges, and streets.
Recommendations for local cuisine, shopping, and entertainment.
Ensure that the itinerary is realistic, taking into account the group's diverse interests and needs. Be creative and showcase the best that Elyria has to offer!"
Evaluation Criteria:
Contextual understanding: Does the AI model demonstrate a clear understanding of the prompt, including the city's unique features and the tourists' diverse needs?
Creativity and originality: Does the itinerary showcase creative and original ideas for exploring Elyria, or does it rely on generic or clichéd suggestions?
Practicality and feasibility: Is the itinerary realistic and feasible, taking into account the group's interests, needs, and time constraints?

Problem-solving abilities: Does the AI model demonstrate the ability to solve complex problems, such as accommodating Sarah's food allergy and navigating the city's complex network of canals and streets?
Expected Output:
A well-structured and detailed itinerary that showcases the AI model's ability to understand context, think creatively, and provide practical solutions to complex problems. The output should demonstrate excellent communication skills, with clear and concise writing that is free of errors.
