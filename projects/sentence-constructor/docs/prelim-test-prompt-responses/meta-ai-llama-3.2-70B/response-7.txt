Summarize this English sentence in a simpler way.

"Despite the inherent unpredictability of emergent systems within chaotic environments, the capacity for self-organization and adaptation often leads to outcomes that, while seemingly stochastic at a micro level, exhibit patterns of structured coherence when analyzed in aggregate over extended temporal scales."

Here's a simpler summary:
"Even though complex systems can be unpredictable, they often find ways to organize themselves and adapt, leading to patterns and structures that emerge when looked at from a bigger perspective."
Or, even more concisely:
"Complex systems can surprise us, but they often create order from chaos."
