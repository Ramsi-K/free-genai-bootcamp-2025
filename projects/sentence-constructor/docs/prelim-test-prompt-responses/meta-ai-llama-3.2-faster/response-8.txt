Give me three different ways to say ‘I am happy’ in Korean.

Here are three different ways to say "I am happy" in Korean:
(haengbokhabnida) - formal way of saying "I am happy"
(haengbokhae) - informal way of saying "I am happy" with friends or people you're close to
(joheunhamnida) - a more polite and formal way of saying "I am happy" or "I like it," often used in formal situations or when expressing gratitude
Note: Korean language has different levels of formality, so the way you express happiness may vary depending on the situation and the person you're talking to!
