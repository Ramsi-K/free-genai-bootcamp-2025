Explain the difference between formal and informal speech in Korean.


In the Korean language, the distinction between formal and informal speech is crucial, as it reflects the hierarchical structure and social dynamics of Korean society. The choice between formal and informal speech depends on the age, social status, and relationship of the people involved in the conversation.

Formal Speech (존댓말, jondaetmal):

Used when speaking to someone older, of higher social status, or in a professional setting.
Shows respect and maintains a certain level of social distance.
Characterized by the use of honorific suffixes such as "-님" (nim) and "-시-" (si).
Verb endings are more complex and polite, such as "-ㅂ니다" (bnida) or "-습니다" (seumnida).
Example: "안녕하세요" (annyeonghaseyo) is a formal way to say "hello."
Informal Speech (반말, banmal):

Used when speaking to someone of the same age or younger, a close friend, or a family member.
Shows familiarity and closeness in the relationship.
Does not use honorific suffixes or special verb endings.
Verb endings are simpler and more casual, such as "-어" (eo) or "-아" (a).
Example: "안녕" (annyeong) is an informal way to say "hello."
It is essential for Korean language learners to understand and use the appropriate speech style depending on the situation and the person they are addressing. Using the wrong speech style can be considered rude or disrespectful. However, as relationships evolve and people become closer, it is common for Koreans to switch from formal to informal speech to reflect the change in their relationship.
