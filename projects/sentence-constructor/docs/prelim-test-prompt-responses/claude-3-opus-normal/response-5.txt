Here's the breakdown:

오늘 아침에 (oneul achime) - this morning
까마귀를 (kkamaguireul) - raven (object marker)
봤어요 (bwasseoyo) - saw (polite, past tense)
그들은 (geudeureun) - they (topic marker)
우리 (uri) - our
정원을 (jeongwoneul) - garden (object marker)
보고 있었어요 (bogo isseosseoyo) - were looking at (polite, past continuous tense)
Note: In Korean, the plural marker is often omitted, so "they" is implied without a specific plural marker for "raven."
