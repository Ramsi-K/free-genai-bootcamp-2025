Organize this information into a structured format you think is best.
Mammal - Dog
Mammal - Cat
Bird - Sparrow
Bird - Eagle
Reptile - Snake
Reptile - Lizard


Here's the information organized into a structured format, specifically a nested list, which I believe is the most suitable for presenting animal classifications:

Animals

Mammals
Dog
Cat
Birds
Sparrow
Eagle
Reptiles
Snake
Lizard
This structure clearly shows the hierarchical relationship between the animal classes (Mammals, Birds, Reptiles) and the specific examples of each class. The nested list format allows for easy readability and understanding of the information presented.
