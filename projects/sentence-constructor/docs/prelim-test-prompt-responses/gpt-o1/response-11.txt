Reptile
    Considering tables

    I'm leaning towards a table to organize the animal types and species. It seems like the ideal approach to present the data in a clear and organized way.

Below is one way to structure the information in a clear, concise formatâ€”grouped by animal category and listing the examples within each group:

| Animal Category	| Examples| 
| Mammal	| Dog, Cat| 
| Bird	| Sparrow, Eagle| 
| Reptile	| Snake, Lizard|
