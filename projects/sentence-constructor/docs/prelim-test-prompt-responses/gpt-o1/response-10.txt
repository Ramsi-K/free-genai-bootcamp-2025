    Organizing relationships

    I’m piecing together the family relationships in Korean, from grandparents to siblings and aunts/uncles. It’s interesting to see how these roles unfold in Korean, creating a streamlined understanding of familial ties.

    Detailing family ties

    I’m pulling together the nuances of Korean family terms: 삼촌 for paternal uncle and 이모 for maternal aunt, ensuring clarity in relationships and respecting familial context in each term.

    Mapping relationships

    I’m pulling together a table to map out English family terms, Korean equivalents, and notes on specific uses, like "형" for older brother and "삼촌" for paternal uncle.

Below is a suggested table grouping each English family term with its corresponding Korean word. Notes have been added where distinctions (such as gender or which side of the family) are relevant:

| Relationship (English)	| Korean Word	| Notes| 
| Grandmother	| 할머니	| | 
| Grandfather	| 할아버지	| | 
| Father	| 아빠	| 
| Mother	| 엄마	| | 
| Older Brother	| 형	| Used by a male speaker to refer to his older brother| 
| Older Sister	| 누나	| Used by a male speaker to refer to his older sister| 
| Uncle (paternal)	| 삼촌	| Refers to father’s brother; “삼촌” specifically denotes an uncle| 
| Aunt (maternal)	| 이모	| Refers to mother’s sister|
