Give me three different ways to say ‘I am happy’ in Korean.

Reasoned about ways to express happiness in Korean for a couple of seconds
Here are three ways to say “I am happy” in Korean, each with a different level of formality:

Formal (높임말):

저는 행복합니다.
(Literally “I am happy,” used in polite/formal settings)
Polite (해요체):

저 행복해요.
(Still respectful but more casual than the formal style)
Informal (반말):

나 행복해.
(Used with close friends, peers, or younger individuals)
