Explain the difference between formal and informal speech in Korean.

Reasoned for a couple of seconds
In Korean, the choice between formal and informal speech is closely tied to the social context and the relationship between the speakers. Here’s an overview:

Politeness Hierarchy
Formal Speech (높임말, “높다” means “high” or “to raise”)

Used in hierarchical situations, when speaking to elders, superiors at work, or anyone you wish to show respect toward.
Characterized by endings like -습니다 / -ㅂ니다 (declarative) and -습니까? (interrogative).
Reflects politeness, professionalism, and distance.
Polite Speech (요 form)

Common in everyday conversation among adults, such as new acquaintances, coworkers, or anyone with whom you aren’t on very casual terms.
Characterized by endings like -아요 / -어요 / -여요 and the question form -아요? / -어요? / -여요?
Polite but less formal than the “-습니다” style.
Informal Speech (반말)

Often used among close friends, family members of similar age, or when talking to younger people.
Characterized by -아 / -어 endings. For instance, “안녕” instead of “안녕하세요” for “hello.”
Conveys closeness, familiarity, or intimacy.
When to Use Each Style
Formal (합니다체): Public speeches, business meetings, news broadcasts, academic presentations, official reports.
Polite (해요체): Day-to-day conversation with strangers, most service interactions (such as a shop or restaurant), or whenever you’re unsure of someone’s social rank relative to your own.
Informal (해체 or 반말): Close friends, siblings, younger family members, and casual online chats among peers.
Key Takeaways
Context Matters: Korean culture places great emphasis on age, status, and relationship. Even a small change in verb endings can drastically change the tone and perceived respect.
Listen & Mirror: Koreans often shift their speech level during conversation to match or respect the other person’s formality level.
Start Formal, Go Informal: It’s safer to begin with polite or formal speech and switch to informal only if you’re invited to do so or when you’ve built a close relationship.
By understanding these nuances, you’ll be able to choose the right level of speech in Korean for each context.
