Reasoned for a couple of seconds
The sky darkened as the storm approached, a rolling shadow stretching across the horizon. Thunder grumbled in the distance like a warning from deep below the earth, and the wind carried the scent of rain and charged electricity. Tree branches swayed in sudden bursts of motion, leaves rattling as if sharing secrets of the tempest to come. Out on the empty road, I felt the first cold droplets strike my shoulders, each one a pinpoint reminder of nature’s immense power.

There was a strange hush just before the downpour—an anticipatory stillness broken only by the distant whistle of the wind. In that charged pause, the world held its breath. Then the clouds unleashed their fury, rain pounding the asphalt and washing over every surface in silvery sheets. Lightning cracked across the sky, illuminating the landscape for fleeting seconds, before thunder roared in echo.

For a moment, the air felt electric with possibility, and I wondered if the storm might bring more than just rain. The wind whipped at my clothing, tugging me forward as if urging me to delve deeper into the chaos rather than seek shelter. I stood, transfixed by the spectacle, unsure whether to run from the storm or embrace its raging energy.
