Tell me something interesting.

Here’s something interesting: Japan has a phone booth in the middle of a garden where people "call" their lost loved ones.

It’s called the Wind Phone (風の電話, Kaze no Denwa), and it was created by a man named Itaru Sasaki in 2010 after he lost his cousin. The phone isn’t connected to any network—it's just a rotary phone in a glass booth overlooking the ocean in Ōtsuchi, a town that was devastated by the 2011 tsunami.

People from all over Japan (and even the world) visit the booth to "talk" to their departed family members, expressing their grief, love, and thoughts. The idea is that the wind will carry their words to those who are no longer with them. It became a powerful symbol of healing and remembrance, especially after the disaster that claimed thousands of lives.

It’s a beautiful example of how people find ways to cope with loss in deeply personal and poetic ways. 🌿📞Tell me something interesting.
