Explain the difference between formal and informal speech in Korean.

ChatGPT said:
In Korean, the level of speech you use depends on the relationship, social status, and context of the conversation. There are several levels of formality, but the main distinction is between formal and informal speech.

1. Formal Speech (존댓말, Jondaetmal)
This is used in polite, professional, or respectful settings, such as:

Speaking to elders, superiors, or strangers.
In workplaces, public announcements, customer service, etc.
When showing politeness or distance.
🔹 Examples:

Declarative (statement):
저는 한국어를 공부하고 있습니다. (I am studying Korean.)
오늘 날씨가 좋네요. (The weather is nice today.)
Interrogative (question):
어디에 사세요? (Where do you live?)
점심 드셨나요? (Have you eaten lunch?)
Common formal endings:

-ㅂ니다 / -습니다 → Very formal (e.g., 합니다, 갑니다)
-아요 / -어요 → Polite but less formal (e.g., 해요, 가요)
2. Informal Speech (반말, Banmal)
This is used in casual or close relationships, such as:

Friends, siblings, younger people, or informal settings.
When talking to children or someone significantly younger.
Dropping formality when both people agree.
🔹 Examples:

Declarative (statement):
나 한국어 공부해. (I study Korean.)
오늘 날씨 좋다. (The weather is nice today.)
Interrogative (question):
어디 살아? (Where do you live?)
밥 먹었어? (Did you eat?)
Common informal endings:

-다 / -어 / -아 → Plain statements (e.g., 간다, 먹어)
-야? / -니? → Casual questions (e.g., 어디 가?, 밥 먹었니?)
Key Differences & Social Rules
Formal speech is safer in uncertain situations.
→ If unsure, start with 존댓말 (polite form) and switch to 반말 only if the other person allows it.
Older people expect 존댓말 from younger people, even in casual settings.
Between friends of the same age, banmal is normal, but some start with 존댓말 and naturally switch later.
Using 반말 with a superior, elder, or stranger can be rude or disrespectful.
Example: The Raven Sentence in Formal & Informal Korean
Formal (존댓말):
오늘 아침에 까마귀 보셨어요? 우리 정원을 보고 있더라고요.
Informal (반말):
오늘 아침에 까마귀 봤어? 우리 정원 보고 있더라.
