Here are three different ways to say "I am happy" in Korean, each with a different nuance:

1️⃣ Formal (존댓말, polite)
➡ 저는 행복해요. (Jeoneun haengbokhaeyo.)

Used in polite conversations, such as with acquaintances or elders.
2️⃣ Casual (반말, informal)
➡ 나 행복해. (Na haengbokhae.)

Used with close friends, family, or people younger than you.
3️⃣ Expressive / Natural (spoken style)
➡ 너무 기분 좋다! (Neomu gibun jota!)

Means "I feel so good!" and is commonly used in everyday speech to express happiness.
