Does the response outline specific steps that will be taken to resolve the issue?
Are these steps clearly communicated to the customer?
Reassurance:

Does the response provide reassurance that the issue will be resolved?

I'll check the tracking information and contact our shipping department to get an update on your package. I'll also make sure to keep you informed every step of the way. If there's any delay on our end, we'll definitely make it right. Thank you for your patience, and I'll get back to you with more information as soon as possible."
