Here's the information organized into a structured format, optimized for clarity and understanding, along with explanations:

Format:  Hierarchical Table with Categorization and Relationship Details

I've chosen a table format because it's excellent for presenting structured data with clear relationships.  The hierarchy helps group related terms, and the additional details improve understanding.

Category	Relationship	Korean Term (Hangul)	Romanization	Notes
Grandparents	Grandmother	할머니	Halmeoni	
Grandfather	할아버지	Harabeoji	
Parents	Mother	엄마	Eomma	
Father	아빠	Appa	
Aunts/Uncles	Aunt (Maternal)	이모	Imo	Mother's sister
Uncle (Generic)	삼촌	Samchon	Traditionally, father's unmarried brother. Can be used more generally, but context is important.
Siblings	Older Sister (Female Speaker)	누나	Nuna	Used by a female to address her older sister.
Older Brother (Male Speaker)	형	Hyeong	Used by a male to address his older brother

Explanation of Choices and Structure:

Categories: Grouping by generation (Grandparents, Parents, Aunts/Uncles, Siblings) makes the relationships immediately clear. This is the most fundamental organizational principle.
Relationship: Specifies the English term for the family member, providing a clear reference point. I've added clarifications where needed (e.g., "Aunt (Maternal)").
Korean Term (Hangul): Provides the Korean word in its native script. This is essential for correct pronunciation and writing.
Romanization: Offers a phonetic representation of the Korean word using the Roman alphabet. This helps with pronunciation for those unfamiliar with Hangul. I've used the Revised Romanization of Korean, the most common system.
Notes: This is the most crucial addition. It provides essential context and clarifies potential ambiguities:
Gendered Sibling Terms: Korean has different words for older siblings depending on the speaker's gender. The table explicitly states this.
"Samchon" Nuance: The note about "삼촌" highlights the traditional usage and the importance of context.
Maternal vs Paternal: The distinction between "이모" and "고모" helps clarify which side of the family the aunt belongs to.
Why this format is superior to a simple list:

Clarity: The table format immediately shows the relationships between the different terms. A list would require more reading and mental processing to understand the connections.
Structure: The hierarchy (categories) provides a logical organization that a list lacks.
Completeness: The "Notes" column allows for crucial contextual information that would be awkward to include in a simple list.
Readability: The table is easy to scan and quickly find specific information.
Learnability: This is layed out in a format that helps to visualize the relationships.
This structured table format provides a comprehensive and user-friendly way to understand Korean family terms.
