Here are three different ways to say "I am happy" in Korean, with explanations of their nuances:

기뻐요 (gippeoyo):

Meaning: This is the most direct and common translation of "I am happy." It focuses on the feeling of joy and gladness.
Formality: Polite (해요체 - haeyoche). Suitable for most everyday conversations.
Usage: Use this when you're feeling genuinely happy, excited, or pleased about something. It's a versatile and widely applicable option.
행복해요 (haengbokhaeyo):

Meaning: This translates more literally to "I am blissful" or "I am content." It describes a deeper, more sustained state of happiness and well-being, rather than a fleeting moment of joy.
Formality: Polite (해요체 - haeyoche).
Usage: Use this when you're talking about a general sense of happiness in your life, or when you feel a profound sense of contentment and fulfillment. It's less about a specific event and more about an overall state of being.
좋아요 (joayo):

Meaning: This literally means "It's good" or "I like it." While not a direct translation of "I am happy," it's often used to express happiness or satisfaction in response to something positive.
Formality: Polite (해요체 - haeyoche).
Usage: Use this when something makes you happy, or when you're expressing your approval or enjoyment of something. For example, if someone asks "How's the food?" you could reply "좋아요!" to mean "It's good, and I'm happy with it!" Or if someone says that your favourite band will be playing in your city, you could say this.
In summary:

기뻐요 (gippeoyo): General, joyful happiness.
행복해요 (haengbokhaeyo): Deep, sustained happiness and contentment.
좋아요 (joayo): Happiness or satisfaction in response to something good.
All three are perfectly acceptable ways to express happiness in Korean. The best choice depends on the specific context and the nuance you want to convey.
