Reasoned about formal vs informal speech in Korean for 6 seconds
    In Korean, the difference between formal and informal speech comes down to respect. Formal speech is used in polite or respectful settings, while informal speech is for close friends or others you’re familiar with. There are various degrees, like polite informal and formal polite speech. The polite endings "요" and "니다" are considered formal. Informal speech uses plain forms and varies in verb conjugation and honorifics, reflecting the cultural emphasis on politeness and respect.

    In Korean, there's a main distinction between formal (존댓말) and informal (반말) speech, which is based on the relationship, age, and social status between speakers. Formal speech uses endings like "-습니다" or "-ㅂ니다" and is used in respectful contexts, like speaking to elders or in public settings. Informal speech is more relaxed, for friends or younger people, and uses simpler forms. These differences extend to vocabulary and subject markers, reflecting the importance of maintaining proper social relationships in Korean.

Korean has a rich system of speech levels that reflects social hierarchy and relationships. Two key categories in this system are formal (존댓말) and informal (반말) speech. Here’s an overview of their differences:

Purpose and Usage:

Formal Speech (존댓말):
Used in situations where respect or politeness is required. This includes conversations with elders, superiors, strangers, or in professional and public settings. It helps maintain social harmony and shows deference.
Informal Speech (반말):
Used among close friends, peers, or people who are of similar age or lower status (and when it’s mutually agreed upon). It creates a relaxed, familiar atmosphere but should be used cautiously, as using informal speech in the wrong context can be seen as disrespectful.
Verb Endings and Grammar:

Formal Speech:
Typically uses verb endings like -습니다 / -ㅂ니다 (in declarative sentences) or -세요 / -으세요 (when asking politely). For example:
"갑니다" (I go)
vs.
"가" (go; informal or plain form)
Informal Speech:
Uses simpler verb endings. The absence of honorific markers makes the language more direct and casual. For example:
"먹어" (eat; informal)
instead of
"먹습니다" or "드십니다" (the latter if using honorifics in a formal setting).
Vocabulary and Honorifics:

In formal speech, speakers often choose vocabulary that is inherently more respectful and may add honorific markers to nouns or verbs to indicate respect toward the subject or listener.
In informal speech, these markers are usually dropped or minimized, which results in a more straightforward and casual language style.
Social Context:

Formal Speech:
Often seen in public announcements, media, and formal business settings. It’s the default mode when you’re unsure of the social hierarchy or when meeting someone for the first time.
Informal Speech:
Common among friends, family members, or colleagues who have an established, relaxed relationship. However, even among peers, switching to formal speech might occur to show extra respect or when addressing sensitive topics.
Cultural Importance:

The use of formal versus informal speech is deeply embedded in Korean culture. It’s not just about grammar—it’s a reflection of respect, hierarchy, and interpersonal dynamics. Mastery of these levels is crucial for effective and culturally appropriate communication in Korean.
Understanding and appropriately using these speech levels is key to navigating social interactions in Korean, ensuring that you communicate respect and familiarity according to the situation.
