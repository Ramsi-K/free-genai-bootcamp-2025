    Okay, I need to organize the information clearly. A family tree-like structure seems like a good approach. I'll note that "Sibling" has two terms: 형 for an older brother and 누나 for an older sister. "Aunt/Uncle" repeats too—삼촌 for paternal uncle and 이모 for maternal aunt.

    Hmm, I could group the terms by generation and relationship type. Maybe a table or a bullet list would work best. Let's see...

    So, I'll organize these into generations based on their role. For Generation 1, I have the Grandparents: 할아버지 (Grandfather) and 할머니 (Grandmother).

    In Generation 2, the parents are represented by 아빠 (Father) and 엄마 (Mother).

    Generation 3 includes siblings—형 (used by a male speaker for an older brother) and 누나 (used by a female speaker for an older sister).

    For extended relatives, 삼촌 is a paternal uncle and 이모 is a maternal aunt.

    I’ll probably structure this as a table.

Below is one way to organize the family relationship terms by generation and role:

1. Grandparents

Grandfather: 할아버지
Grandmother: 할머니
2. Parents

Father: 아빠
Mother: 엄마
3. Siblings

Sibling (Male, older brother): 형
Sibling (Female, older sister): 누나
4. Extended Family (Aunts/Uncles)

Aunt/Uncle (typically paternal): 삼촌
Aunt/Uncle (typically maternal): 이모
Note:

In Korean, the choice between 형 and 누나 depends on the speaker's gender and the relative age. "형" is used by males for an older brother, while "누나" is used by females for an older sister.
Similarly, 삼촌 usually refers to a paternal uncle, and 이모 refers to a maternal aunt, reflecting traditional familial distinctions.
