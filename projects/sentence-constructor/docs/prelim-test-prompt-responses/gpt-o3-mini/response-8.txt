Give me three different ways to say ‘I am happy’ in Korean.

Reasoned about ways to say 'I am happy' in Korean for 6 seconds
    For saying "I am happy" in Korean, I can offer three options with different levels of formality:

    "행복해요" is polite, though not overly formal.
    "저는 행복합니다" is formal, using the "-ㅂ니다" ending.
    "나는 행복해" is informal, often used with close friends.
    Additionally, "기뻐요" could substitute as it also expresses happiness, though it’s more specific to feeling joyful or delighted. So, three options: polite, formal, informal.

    To answer the user's query, I can give three variations based on formality.

    "나는 행복해" (informal – used with friends)
    "나는 행복해요" (polite – casual polite)
    "저는 행복합니다" (formal – to show respect)
    Alternatively, I could mention "기쁘다" (delighted/joyful) but it's a bit of a different nuance. For instance, "나는 기뻐" could work informally, but I'd stick to these three for now. I'll include the breakdown and transliterations too.

Here are three different ways to say "I am happy" in Korean, each reflecting a different level of formality:

Informal:

나는 행복해.
(Na-neun haengbokhae.)
Use this with close friends or people of the same age in casual settings.
Polite (Standard):

나는 행복해요.
(Na-neun haengbokhaeyo.)
This is a polite form suitable for everyday conversation when you want to be respectful but not overly formal.
Formal:

저는 행복합니다.
(Jeo-neun haengbokhamnida.)
This is a formal, respectful way to express the same sentiment, often used in professional or formal contexts.
Each version conveys the same meaning but is tailored to different social situations.
