Focusing on the garden:  오늘 아침에 우리 정원에 까마귀가 있었는데, 보셨어요? (Oneul achime uri jeongwone kkamagwiga isseonneunde, bosyeosseoyo?) - This version emphasizes the presence of the raven in the garden.

A few notes:

까마귀 (kkamagwi) means raven.
The sentence structure in Korean is different from English, so the word order is adjusted accordingly.
The "-던데요" (-deondeyo) and "-더라" (-deora) endings add a sense of observation or recollection. They imply that the speaker saw the raven.
