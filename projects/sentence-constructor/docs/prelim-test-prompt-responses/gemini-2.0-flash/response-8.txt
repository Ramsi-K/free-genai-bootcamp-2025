Give me three different ways to say ‘I am happy’ in Korean.


Here are three ways to say "I am happy" in Korean, with varying levels of formality:

Formal:  저는 행복합니다 (Jeoneun haengbokhamnida) - This is the most formal way to say it and is appropriate for situations where you need to show respect, like speaking to someone older than you, a superior, or in a formal setting.

Standard/Polite: 저는 행복해요 (Jeoneun haengbokhaeyo) - This is a polite and common way to express happiness. It's suitable for most everyday situations.  You'll hear this a lot.

Informal:  나 행복해 (Na haengbokhae) - This is an informal way to say "I'm happy." Use it with close friends, family members, or people younger than you.  "Na" is the informal "I."
