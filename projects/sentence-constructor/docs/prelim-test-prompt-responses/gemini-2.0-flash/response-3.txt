The sky darkened as the storm approached, a bruised purple bleeding into the once-vibrant blue.  A low rumble, like a giant clearing its throat, echoed across the plains, growing louder with each passing second.  The wind, which had been a gentle caress moments before, now whipped and snarled, tugging at loose branches and sending dust devils swirling across the parched earth.  Birds, sensing the impending fury, had fallen silent, their cheerful chirps replaced by an eerie stillness.  A single, fat raindrop splattered against the dry windowpane, leaving a dark, fleeting mark.  Then another, and another, until the glass was covered in a shimmering curtain.  The rumble intensified into a deafening roar, and a jagged streak of lightning illuminated the sky, followed almost instantly by a thunderclap that shook the very foundations of the house.  The storm had arrived.
