Tell me something interesting.


Did you know that there's a species of jellyfish called the "immortal jellyfish" (Turritopsis dohrnii) that can revert back to its polyp stage when it's injured or stressed? This means it can potentially live forever, barring any accidents or diseases!

It's a pretty fascinating example of how some creatures have evolved incredible survival mechanisms.
