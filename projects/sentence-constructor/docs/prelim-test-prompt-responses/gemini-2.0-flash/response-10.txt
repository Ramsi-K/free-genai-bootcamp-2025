It seems like you're providing a list of Korean family terms. Here's how I'd organize this information into a structured format:

Family Member	Korean Term	Notes
Grandmother	할머니 (halmeoni)	
Grandfather	할아버지 (harabeoji)
Mother	엄마 (eomma)
Father	아빠 (appa)
Aunt/Uncle	이모 (imo)	Mother's sister
Aunt/Uncle	삼촌 (samchon)	Father's brother OR mother's brother
Sibling	형 (hyeong)	Older brother (used by males)
Sibling	누나 (nuna)	Older sister (used by males)

Things to note about Korean family terms:

Gender matters: Korean has different terms depending on the gender of the speaker and the relative. For example, a male speaker uses "형" for older brother and "누나" for older sister.
Paternal vs. Maternal: There are often distinct terms for relatives on the mother's side and the father's side.
Age matters: Korean distinguishes between older and younger siblings.
Politeness levels: Like other aspects of Korean, there are formal and informal ways to address family members.
To make this even more complete, we could add:

Terms for younger siblings (동생 - dongsaeng)
Terms for cousins (사촌 - sachon)
Honorific titles (-씨, -님) used with family names in formal situations
