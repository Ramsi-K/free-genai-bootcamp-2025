Explain the difference between formal and informal speech in Korean.


In Korean, the system of formal and informal speech (honorifics) is complex and deeply embedded in the culture. Here are the key differences:

Formal Speech (높임말/Nopimmal):

Used with strangers, elders, superiors, or in professional settings
Main formal endings include "-습니다/ㅂ니다" (-seumnida/mnida) and "-요" (-yo)
Shows respect and maintains social distance
Example: "안녕하십니까?" (annyeonghashimnikka? - formal "hello")
Informal Speech (반말/Banmal):

Used with close friends, family members of similar or younger age, or children
Main informal endings include "-아/어" (-a/eo) and "-지" (-ji)
Shows intimacy and closeness
Example: "안녕?" (annyeong? - informal "hello")
Additional considerations:

Verb conjugations change based on formality level
Different vocabulary words may be used (e.g., formal "드시다" vs informal "먹다" for "to eat")
Context and relationship between speakers determine appropriate level
Using the wrong level can be considered rude or socially inappropriate
Would you like me to provide more specific examples of how these differences play out in everyday conversations?
