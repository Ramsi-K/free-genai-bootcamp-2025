The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928, which ushered in the age of antibiotics and transformed modern medicine's ability to fight bacterial infections.
The development of agriculture in multiple locations around 12,000 years ago, which allowed humans to transition from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled societies.
