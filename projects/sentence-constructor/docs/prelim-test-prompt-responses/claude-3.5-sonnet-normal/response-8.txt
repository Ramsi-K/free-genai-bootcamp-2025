Give me three different ways to say ‘I am happy’ in Korean.


Here are three ways to say "I am happy" in Korean, ranging from formal to informal:

저는 행복합니다 (jeoneun haengbokhamnida)
Most formal version
Used in professional settings or with people you need to show respect to
행복해요 (haengbokhaeyo)
Politely casual
Common in everyday situations with people you don't know well or with elders
행복해 (haengbokhae)

Would you like me to explain when to use each version in more detail?
