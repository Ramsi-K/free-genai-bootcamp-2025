Here's a structured organization of Korean family terms, grouped by generation and relationship:

Grandparents' Generation

할아버지 (harabeoji) - Grandfather
할머니 (halmeoni) - Grandmother
Parents' Generation

아빠 (appa) - Father
엄마 (eomma) - Mother
삼촌 (samchon) - Uncle (father's side)
이모 (imo) - Aunt (mother's side)
Sibling Terms

형 (hyeong) - Older brother (used by male)
누나 (nuna) - Older sister (used by male)
Note: Korean family terms often differ based on:

Whether the relative is from mother's or father's side
The speaker's gender
Age relationship (older/younger)
Marriage status of the relative
Would you like me to explain any of these distinctions in more detail?
