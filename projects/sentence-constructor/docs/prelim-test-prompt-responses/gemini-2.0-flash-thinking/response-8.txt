Show thinking
    The user is asking for three different ways to express "I am happy" in Korean, varying in formality or nuance. I should provide options that showcase different levels of politeness and potentially slightly different shades of meaning within the concept of happiness. I will aim for:

    Polite and general: This should be the most common and versatile way to say "I am happy" in a standard polite context.
    More informal/casual: This should be appropriate for friends or close acquaintances.
    Slightly more emphatic or nuanced: This could express a stronger sense of happiness or a slightly different flavor of happiness, while still remaining relatively common.

Here are three different ways to say "I am happy" in Korean, each with a slightly different nuance and level of formality:

가장 흔하고 정중한 표현 (Most common and polite expression):  행복합니다 (Haengbokhamnida)

Level of Formality: Very Polite, Formal (하십시오체 - Hasipsio-che)
Breakdown:
행복 (haengbok): Happiness (noun)
합니다 (hamnida): "am/do/does" in a very formal and polite way (from 하다 - hada - to do/be, in the formal -ㅂ니다 ending)
Nuance: This is the most standard, polite, and slightly formal way to say "I am happy." It's suitable for formal situations, speaking to elders, or in public speaking. It conveys a clear and respectful sense of happiness.
Example Situation: Giving a formal speech, thanking someone in a very respectful way, writing a formal letter.
일상적이고 정중한 표현 (Everyday and polite expression): 행복해요 (Haengbokhaeyo)

Level of Formality: Polite, Everyday (하세요체 - Haseyo-che)
Breakdown:
행복 (haengbok): Happiness (noun)
해요 (haeyo): "am/do/does" in a polite way (from 하다 - hada - to do/be, in the polite -요 ending)
Nuance: This is the most common and versatile way to say "I am happy" in Korean. It's polite enough for most situations, including talking to strangers, acquaintances, people older than you (unless they are significantly older or in a very formal setting), and in general everyday conversation. It's friendly and polite without being overly stiff.
Example Situation: Talking to a cashier, chatting with a colleague you're friendly with, telling a new acquaintance how you feel.
친근하고 편안한 표현 (Friendly and comfortable expression): 기뻐요 (Gippeoyo)

Level of Formality: Polite, but can also be used more casually with people you are comfortable with. (세요체 - Seyo-che form of 기쁘다 - gippeuda)
Breakdown:
기쁘다 (gippeuda): To be pleased, delighted, joyful (verb in its dictionary form)
기뻐요 (gippeoyo): "am pleased/delighted/joyful" (polite -요 form)
Nuance: While technically still polite, "기뻐요 (Gippeoyo)" leans slightly more towards expressing joy or delight. It's often used when you are happy about something specific or experiencing a more active, joyful kind of happiness. It can be used in polite situations but also with close friends and family to express a warm, happy feeling. It's often perceived as slightly more emotive than just "행복해요 (Haengbokhaeyo)".
Example Situation: Expressing happiness about receiving a gift, hearing good news, seeing a friend after a long time, telling someone "I'm glad to see you," or simply stating "I'm happy" in a warm, friendly way.
In summary:

행복합니다 (Haengbokhamnida): Very Formal "I am happy" (Standard happiness, polite and formal)
행복해요 (Haengbokhaeyo): Polite "I am happy" (Standard happiness, versatile and polite)
기뻐요 (Gippeoyo): Polite/Casual "I am happy/delighted/joyful" (Happiness with a nuance of joy or delight, warm and friendly)
