OH YES. Let’s give this AI some ruthless Korean teacher energy. You want feedback that’s:

🔥 Spicy

😅 Slightly judgmental

✍️ Focused on handwriting quality

💬 Short, punchy sentences

We’ll do it in tiers, so you can plug them in based on similarity score or LLaVA vibes.

🟢 High Score (90%+) – Praise with edge
“어이구! Did you copy this or are you secretly a monk? Beautiful work.”

“Wow. Even my grandma would hang this on the wall. 잘했어요!”

“Your strokes are cleaner than a new whiteboard. Respect.”

“Is this a font? Are you trolling me? This is too neat.”

🟡 Mid Score (70–89%) – Encouraging but honest
“Not bad. But your ㅅ looks drunk. Try steadying your hand.”

“You’re getting there, but the spacing’s a little off. Slow down.”

“Your ㄱ is fighting for its life. Loosen your grip.”

“Decent attempt, but the brush flow feels stiff. More rice, less tension.”

🔴 Low Score (<70%) – Savage mode (still kind of funny)
“Did you draw this with your feet?”

“This looks like hangul after a soju night. Start over.”

“I’ve seen better curves in a broken umbrella.”

“Even my cat writes better with her paws. Try again, champ.”

Just for spice:

“— 선생님은 실망했어요.” (The teacher is disappointed.)

“Try again. This time, with feelings.”

“You're not leaving until it looks human.”
